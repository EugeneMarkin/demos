Before being able to export .EAD files from 3Ds Max, you'll need to install the exporter:

STEP 1 - Look for EAD Exporter.dle in the provided package. Select it and copy it.

STEP 2 - Install the plugin into 3Ds Max
You need to paste the file (EAD Exporter.dle), inside the stdplugs folder into the installation directory of 3Ds Max.
If you have 3Ds Max started, reinitialize it. When you start it, you'll now be able to export in .EAD format from the Export menu.
