   What is the Image Tracking engine?
========================================

Object and image tracking engine. Once you recognize the image you can follow it to super pose extra information. This engine tracks the image position at any time and returns several information about it: the image you have tracked and recognized , the current position of the image (four corners) and the projection matrix so you can easily integrate it with our 3D render engine or any other 3D engine you use.
